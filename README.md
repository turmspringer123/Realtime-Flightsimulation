# flightsimmer
 
I build this app for free and non commercial ideas for flightsimulation with a lot of inspiration 


from :

from :
https://github.com/mracko/MSFS-Mobile-Companion-App
and many more from Q&A stackoverflow and some ideas from chatGPT.......

Its a learning proccess to understand different codes like python and node.js , so Im happy about suggestions to get better programming understanding.

You can use this app for MSFS-Flightsimulator

To run:

1. Start MSFS-Flightsimulator
2. Start your flight
3. start server.exe
4. start helper-shortcut.exe
5. Under templates, you can set your openweathermap api to use wind and flighttime informations.
6. Your flightplans can be load via static flightplan. You can only use kml flightplans, downloaded for example from simbrief.com

Please tell me, if I  violence some rights from codes.
Thank you.
